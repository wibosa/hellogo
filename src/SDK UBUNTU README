$ sudo apt-get install golang-go

If that's too old for you, try:

$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gophers/archive
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install golang-1.10-go

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gophers/archive
 Co-installable packages of Go 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, and tip for Ubuntu Trusty, Wily, Xenial and Yakkety.

Installing golang-1.X installs the latest point release of Go 1.X. I add the odd patch to keep older versions of Go building with new toolchains, but I do *not* make any effort to backport security fixes to Go releases that are not supported by upstream. Buyer beware!

The golang-tip package is a bit different, it will always track Go tip (it is updated manually and somewhat erratically currently). I start uploading a release when its first beta is released, so e.g. I uploaded a golang-1.7  package after 1.7 beta 1 was released.

So these packages can be co-installable, they do not install anything to /usr/bin. Once you have installed the golang-1.X package, you will need to add /usr/lib/go-1.X/bin (or maybe /usr/lib/go-tip/bin) to your $PATH, or you can just invoke /usr/lib/go-1.X/bin/go directly.

The packages all Recommend: appropriate versions of the runtime race detector support on amd64, which are also built in this PPA.
